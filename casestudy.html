                    Women’s safety has become a matter of prime concern in the present day. There is no resource more potent for growth than women’s empowerment. I, along with some of my batchmates, as a team, took part in a design sprint organized by DesignTab 
                    — The Official Design Club of NIT Rourkela. As a team, we designed an SOS app and product for enhanced women security.

                    As a team, we had participated in the design sprint organized by DesignTab — The Official Design Club of NIT Rourkela. The sprint was held a day after the conduction of a session on The Basics of
                     UX Design and Design Sprint. The allotted problem statement to all the teams was:
                  </p>
                  <p style="font-weight: bold;color:#1dd1a1;">
                    Design a service/product/app/etc. that should focus on women’s safety.

                    For the design sprint, I teamed up with three of my colleagues
                     — <a href="">Smithraj Karna</a>, Sai Swarup Mohanty, and Rama Kushna Behera. Each of us had relative expertise in different fields, thereby creating a diverse group for the sprint.

                    Multiple consecutive team meetings were held to discuss the problem statement. Since Women’s Safety was too broad a topic, we had to focus our attention on any one of the prime issues under this category. Now that we had analyzed the problem,
                     we decided to focus our attention since that would be helpful in case of an emergency(like attack, harassment, accident, etc.)

                  <p>
                    Based on the user research, we established two user groups(based on possession of smartwatch) — one who owned a smartwatch and another one included those who did not have a smartwatch. Based on a brief market analysis, it was discovered that good quality smartwatches tend to be costlier than a band.
                     To ensure that those who do not possess a smartwatch aren’t ignored, we came up with the concept of using a band.

                  Depending on the necessity of the user, either of the user flows were to be followed.

                  With a solution based on the field of women’s safety, more features can be added to the smartwatch app as well as the band in collaboration with various companies and the government, thereby improving its usability and functionality. The features of the band can also be integrated with products such as Mi Band, Fitbit, etc.
                   to increase the functionality and value which may be more demanding in the market than the SOS band as a standalone product.
